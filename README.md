## 🔄 IMPORTANT UPDATE — PLEASE READ FIRST

**If you installed an earlier version of Wheel Library, you MUST remove it and reinstall.**  
Recent updates changed how the app loads and caches data, and older installs may keep showing outdated or demo content.

### ✅ To update cleanly (takes ~30 seconds)

### 📱 On iPhone / iPad
1. Find **Wheel Library** on your Home Screen  
2. Press and hold the icon  
3. Tap **Remove App** → **Delete App**  
   *(This does NOT delete any shared data — it only removes the local app cache)*  
4. Open Safari and go to:  
   👉 **https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library**  
5. Tap **Share** → **Add to Home Screen**  
6. You're good to go ✨

### 🤖 On Android
1. Uninstall the existing **Wheel Library** app  
2. Open Chrome and visit:  
   👉 **https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library**  
3. Tap **⋮** → **Add to Home Screen**

### 🧠 Why this matters
This app is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, which means:
- Your phone remembers older versions  
- Updates don't always refresh automatically  
- A fresh install guarantees you're seeing the newest behavior  

If something looks weird after reinstalling, that's a **bug**, not user error — please tell me 💛

# 🛼 WHEEL LIBRARY (Beta… like REALLY beta)
### *A groovy little experiment for skaters who want to try wheels without marrying them.*

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT! THIS IS NOT A FINISHED APP 🚨
This is **just the beginning**, not the middle, and definitely not the end.  
Nothing here is polished, official, complete, or FDA-approved.  

This is a *proof-of-concept*, a *prototype*, and maybe even a *fever dream*.

If you have thoughts, ideas, questions, concerns, compliments, complaints, or cookies —  
come find me in the **SFF Wheel Warehouse**.

---

## 🌈 What This Does (Right Now)
- Lets you check out *pretend* wheels  
- Lets you filter wheels by:
  - Environment  
  - Durometer  
  - Size  
  - Material  
- Helps you match a "vibe" (and isn't that the whole point anyway?)  
- Functions as a **PWA**, so you can add it to your phone like a real app  
  *(because fake it till you make it)*

---

## 🛞 What This *Will* Do Eventually (✨Manifesting✨)
- Real wheel inventory check-outs and returns  
- Borrower tracking  
- Wheel review system (so you can tell everyone why you loved or hated that one slidey set)
- Notes, saved favorites, wheel comparisons  
- Photos, reviews, and maybe even ✨sparkles✨  
- A full mobile loaner program interface for SFF
- Heck, maybe even a snack bar

---

## 📲 How to Install on Your Phone
1. Open the deployed site in Safari:  
   **https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library**
2. Tap the **Share** button  
3. Choose **Add to Home Screen**  
4. Boom — instant retro wheel app  

*(Android: Chrome → ⋮ → Add to Home Screen)*

## 🧪 Want to Help Me Test?
⚠️ **If you previously installed the app and something seems off, try deleting and reinstalling — PWAs are sneaky like that.**

I'd *LOVE* testers! Push the buttons, check out the notes on the bottom.  
Just don't lick anything.

Message me in the **SFF Wheel Warehouse** with:
- Bugs  
- Confusing parts  
- Missing features  
- Weird behavior  
- Ideas  
- Vibes  
- Job Offers

You won't hurt my feelings — but it is **NOT baby deer hunting season** either.  
This whole thing is made of duct tape, unicorn kisses, and vibes.

## 🐞 Known Issues (Working On It!)
- Cache can be sticky sometimes (hence the "delete and reinstall" dance)
- Google Sheets data might take a second to load on first visit
- The loan tracking is just a mockup right now (doesn't persist across sessions)
- That floating button in the corner? That's **Eruda** — my mobile debugging tool. It'll vanish before launch.

*These will all get fixed as we go! Rome wasn't debugged in a day.*

---

## 🛠️ Nerd Stuff (If You Care)
- Built as a static HTML/CSS/JS PWA  
- Deployed via GitHub Pages  
- Uses a service worker for caching  
- Icons generated with love and questionable taste  
- Designed on an iPhone with Koder like a complete gremlin  
  *(yes, really — ancient laptop, ancient editors)*

---

## 🐛 Mobile Debugging (For Fellow Nerds)
This app includes **Eruda** for on-device debugging:
- That floating button in the bottom-right corner? That's it.
- Tap it to access Console, Network, and Storage tabs
- Super handy for seeing errors on mobile
- **This is temporary** — it'll be removed before the official community launch

*(If you're seeing weird errors in the console, screenshot them and send them my way! Extra credit if you draw a little smiley face on the screenshot.)*
