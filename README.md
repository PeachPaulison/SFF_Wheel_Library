🔄 IMPORTANT UPDATE — PLEASE READ FIRST

If you installed an earlier version of Wheel Library, you MUST remove it and reinstall.
Recent updates changed how the app loads and caches data, and older installs may keep showing outdated or demo content.

✅ To update cleanly (takes ~30 seconds):

On iPhone / iPad
	1.	Find Wheel Library on your Home Screen
	2.	Press and hold the icon
	3.	Tap Remove App → Delete App
(This does NOT delete any shared data — it only removes the local app cache)
	4.	Open Safari and go to:
👉 https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library
	5.	Tap Share → Add to Home Screen
	6.	You’re good to go ✨

On Android
	1.	Uninstall the existing Wheel Library app
	2.	Open Chrome and visit:
👉 https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library
	3.	Tap ⋮ → Add to Home Screen

🧠 Why this matters

This app is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means:
	•	Your phone remembers older versions
	•	Updates don’t always refresh automatically
	•	A fresh install guarantees you’re seeing the newest behavior

If something looks weird after reinstalling, that’s a bug, not user error — please tell me 💛

# 🛼 WHEEL LIBRARY (Beta… like REALLY beta)
### *A groovy little experiment for skaters who want to try wheels without marrying them.*

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT! THIS IS NOT A FINISHED APP 🚨  
This is **just the beginning**, not the middle, and definitely not the end.  
Nothing here is polished, official, complete, or FDA-approved.  
This is a *proof-of-concept*, a *prototype*, and maybe even a *fever dream*.  

If you have thoughts, ideas, questions, concerns, compliments, complaints, or cookies —  
come find me in the **SFF Wheel Warehouse**.

---

## 🌈 What This Does (Right Now)
- Lets you check out *pretend* wheels  
- Lets you filter wheels by:
  - Environment  
  - Durometer  
  - Size  
  - Material  
- Helps you match a “vibe” (and isn’t that the whole point anyway?)  
- Functions as a **PWA**, so you can add it to your phone like a real app  
  *(because fake it till you make it)*

---

## 🛞 What This *Will* Do Eventually (Manifesting ✨)
- Real wheel inventory  
- Real check-outs and returns  
- Borrower tracking  
- Notes, saved favorites, wheel comparisons  
- Photos, reviews, and maybe even ✨sparkles✨  
- A full mobile loaner program interface for SFF

---

## 📲 How to Install on Your Phone  
1. Open the deployed site in Safari:  
   **https://peachpaulison.github.io/SFF_Wheel_Library**
2. Tap the **Share** button in Safari  
3. Choose **Add to Home Screen**  
4. Boom — instant retro wheel app

(*If you're on Android: use Chrome → ⋮ menu → Add to Home Screen*)

## 🧪 Want to Help Me Test?  
⚠️ If you previously installed the app and something seems off, try deleting and reinstalling — PWAs are sneaky like that.

I’d *LOVE* testers!  Push the buttons, check out the notes on the bottom.
Just don't lick anything. Try it out and message me in the **SFF Wheel Warehouse** with anything you notice:
- Bugs  
- Confusing parts  
- Missing features  
- Weird behavior  
- Ideas  
- Vibes  

You won’t hurt my feelings, BUT it is NOT baby deer hunting season 
either. This whole thing is made of duct tape, unicorn kisses and vibes.

## 🛠️ Nerd Stuff (If You Care)
- Built as a static HTML/CSS/JS PWA  
- Deployed via GitHub Pages  
- Uses a service worker for caching  
- Icons generated with love and questionable sanity  
- Designed on an iPhone with Koder like a complete gremlin  
  (yup, really... my laptop is ancient and i havent updated my code
  editors in years)
